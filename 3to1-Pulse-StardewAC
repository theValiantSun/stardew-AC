/* All three buttons are mapped to one other button, but the release of the button is independent. That is, when you press your AC key, the mapped keys are pressed and then released without requiring you to release your AC key. Only one pulse per input is allowed. The duration of the pulse can be modified, but note that too short a pulse may not be recognized by your PC.
 
How to Use: Left-click and then press space to cancel the animation. You can click for your next action before you release the spacebar. 
Pros: larger timing window for starting your next action, making it easier to learn and do well
Cons: movement while animation canceling is much more difficult

This script remaps all animation canceling keys to space. */
